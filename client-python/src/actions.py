class ThrowAction(Action):
    '''
    Actions that makes the player throw a snowball at the desired destination. The player will charge his shot for a certain amount of time before throwing. The number of charging frames is defined by (distance / 15).

    The minimum/maximum distances the player can throw are determined by MIN_DISTANCE and MAX_DISTANCE. If the destination is beyond one of those values, it will be rounded up/down to MIN_DISTANCE / MAX_DISTANCE.
    
    The speed of the snowball depends of the throwing distance. At DISTANCE_FOR_MIN_SPEED, the speed is MIN_SPEED. Any distance below that will have the same speed. At DISTANCE_FOR_MAX_SPEED, the speed is MAX_SPEED. Any distance higher will have the same speed.
    
    The damage of the snowball = distance * DAMAGE_PER_DISTANCE_UNIT
    
    A snowball will hit any player in a radius of MIN_HIT_DISTANCE, and it disappears on impact. If many players are within MIN_HIT_DISTANCE, they will all be damaged.
